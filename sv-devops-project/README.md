* 🌐 Frontend Application
* ⚙️ Backend API
* 🗄 Database
* 🐳 Docker
* ☸️ Kubernetes
* 🧪 GitHub Actions

The project is divided into **4 main parts**.

---

# 📦 Part 1 – Three-Tier Application (25 Points)

## 🎯 Objective

Build a complete hotel reservation system using a three-tier architecture.

---

## 🌐 Layer 1 – Frontend Application

### Requirements

Develop a frontend application using:

* JavaScript
* OR TypeScript

The application must contain multiple screens.

---

### Screen 1 – New Reservation

The user must:

* Select a hotel from the available list
* Enter:

  * Full Name
  * Email Address
  * Check-In Date
  * Check-Out Date

If the selected dates are available, the user should receive a confirmation message indicating that the reservation was successfully completed.

---

### Screen 2 – Reservation Lookup

The user must:

* Enter Full Name or Email Address

The application should:

* Retrieve reservation details from the database
* Display reservation information if found
* Allow the user to cancel the reservation

---

## ⚙️ Layer 2 – Backend Application

### Requirements

Develop a backend application using:

* JavaScript
* OR Python

---

### Function 1 – Create Reservation

The backend must:

* Validate reservation details
* Verify business rules
* Store reservation data in the database
* Return a success message

---

### Function 2 – Reservation Lookup

The backend must:

* Receive a Reservation ID
* Verify the reservation exists
* Return reservation details

---

### Function 3 – Cancel Reservation

The backend must:

* Receive a Reservation ID
* Verify the reservation exists
* Remove the reservation from the database
* Return a cancellation confirmation

---

## 🗄 Layer 3 – Database

You may choose:

* MySQL
* OR MongoDB

---

### Table / Collection 1 – Hotels

Each hotel must contain:

```text
Hotel ID
Hotel Name
Description
Location
Price Per Night
```

---

### Table / Collection 2 – Reservations

Each reservation must contain:

```text
Reservation ID
Full Name
Email Address
Check-In Date
Check-Out Date
Hotel ID
```

---

### Database Client UI

You must deploy a database client UI based on your selected database.

Examples:

* Mongo Express
* phpMyAdmin
* Adminer

---

# ☸️ Part 2 – Deployment (25 Points)

## 🎯 Objective

Deploy the entire platform into a local Kubernetes cluster.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

Supported platforms:

* Minikube
* Kind
* Docker Desktop Kubernetes

---

### Kubernetes Requirements

Deploy all components from Part 1.

Use:

* Dedicated Namespaces
* Persistent Volumes
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets

---

### Replica Requirements

#### Frontend

```text
5 Replicas
```

#### Backend

```text
5 Replicas
```

#### Database

```text
3 Replicas
```
---

# 🧪 Part 3 – Build Process (25 Points)

## 🎯 Objective

Use GitHub Actions and automate the build process.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline 1 – Build Pipeline

### Trigger

```text
PUSH → DEV Branch
```

### Responsibilities

1. Build application artifacts
2. Build Docker images
3. Push images to DockerHub Repository

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline 2 – Deployment Preparation Pipeline

### Trigger

```text
After Build Pipeline Completes
```

### Responsibilities

1. Update image tag references
2. Replace old image version with new version
3. Open Pull Request to MAIN
4. Approve Pull Request
5. Merge Pull Request

---

# 🚀 Part 4 – Deployment Process (25 Points)

## 🎯 Objective

Deploy applications automatically using ArgoCD.

---

## 📌 Requirements

Deploy ArgoCD using:

* Dedicated Namespace
* Persistent Volumes
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets

---

## Application 1 – Frontend

### Trigger

```text
Changes in MAIN Branch
```

### Responsibilities

* Detect manifest changes
* Deploy frontend updates automatically

---

## Application 2 – Backend

### Trigger

```text
Changes in MAIN Branch
```

### Responsibilities

* Detect manifest changes
* Deploy backend updates automatically

---

## 🔐 Repository Authentication

Connect GitHub using:

* SSH Keys
* OR Personal Access Token (PAT)

---

# 🔐 Git Requirements

* Create a 3 Private Repositories

Branch strategy:

```text
MAIN → Production
DEV → Development
```

* Work ONLY on DEV
* Open Pull Requests to MAIN

---

## 👤 Add Collaborator

You must add:

* Email: [yakirbar7820@gmail.com](mailto:yakirbar7820@gmail.com)
* GitHub: [https://github.com/YakirBar](https://github.com/YakirBar)

Only after PR approval will it be merged into MAIN.
