## Cheat Sheet - Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| `=`      | Equal (strings) | String |
| `!=`     | Not equal (strings) | String |
| `-eq`    | Equal (numbers) | Number |
| `-ne`    | Not equal (numbers) | Number |
| `-gt`    | Greater than | Number |
| `-lt`    | Less than | Number |
| `-ge`    | Greater or equal | Number |
| `-le`    | Less or equal | Number |

### Important Rule
- Use `=` and `!=` for **text** (strings)
- Use `-eq`, `-gt`, `-lt` for **numbers**
